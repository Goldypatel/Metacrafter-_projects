**#Description** <br/>
ERC20 is a standard for Ethereum tokens. OpenZeppelin provides a secure and community-vetted library to create ERC20 tokens easily. It includes functions like transfer, balanceOf, and allowance, ensuring compliance with the ERC20 standard. This streamlines development, enhancing security and efficiency for blockchain projects.

**#Getting Started**<br/>
**Introduction**<br/>
This project demonstrates basic Creation of a crypto token through ERC20 using openzeppelin public ERC20 contract. Here in this contract we have mint, burn and transfer function to the respectivev tasks. This then is deployed using remix - Ethereum IDE

**Basic usage of functions created**<br/>
->Mint<br/>
Increases the total supply by creating new tokens and assigning them to a specified account. This can be implemented with a mint function that increments both the total supply and the recipient's balance.<br/>
->Burn<br/>
Reduces the total supply by permanently destroying a specified amount of tokens from a holder's balance. This can be implemented with a burn function that decrements both the total supply and the sender's balance.<br/>
->Transfer<br/>
Moves tokens from one account to another. The transfer function ensures tokens are deducted from the sender's balance and added to the recipient's balance, maintaining total supply.

**Executing program**<br/>
1 ) Compile the code using solidity compiler present on he left side of remix (default) <br/>
2 ) Then Run and Deply transactions (just below compiler )<br/>
